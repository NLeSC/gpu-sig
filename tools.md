# GPU Tools
Here are some GPU tools and libraries commonly used and (partially) developed at NLeSC.

- [Kernel Tuner](https://github.com/KernelTuner/kernel_tuner/): Software development tool for the creation of highly-optimized and tuned GPU applications.
- [Kernel Launcher](https://github.com/KernelTuner/kernel_launcher):  Using C++ magic to launch/capture CUDA kernels and tune them with Kernel Tuner 
- [Kernel Float](https://github.com/KernelTuner/kernel_float): header-only library to use vector and low-precision floating-point types (16 bit, 8 bit) in GPU code 
- [CUDA wrappers](https://github.com/nlesc-recruit/cudawrappers):  C++ wrapper for the Nvidia/HIP C libraries (e.g. CUDA driver, nvrtc, hiprtc, cuFFT, hipFFT, etc.)
- [KMM](https://github.com/NLeSC-COMPAS/kmm): A lightweight C++ middleware for accelerated GPU computing 
- [PowerSensor 3](https://github.com/nlesc-recruit/PowerSensor3): custom-built device that measures the instantaneous power consumption of GPUs and other devices at a high time resolution. 
- [nvmetrics](https://github.com/nlesc-recruit/nvmetrics): library designed to facilitate the measurement of GPU metrics using NVIDIA CUPTI (CUDA Profiling Tools Interface)
- [KT dashboard](https://github.com/KernelTuner/dashboard):  Monitor, analyze, and visualize an active or completed auto-tuning run of Kernel Tuner
- [ccglib](https://git.astron.nl/RD/recruit/ccglib): CUDA library provides complex GEMM kernels for complex data.
- [PMT](https://git.astron.nl/RD/pmt): PMT is a high-level software library capable of collecting power consumption
measurements on various hardware.
