# GPU-SIG: GPU Computing Special Interest Group

The special interest group on GPU Computing of the Netherlands eScience Center comes together roughly every three weeks to share knowledge and experience on the latest research and technological developments relevant to accelerated computing. 

The meetings are usually centered around a single presentation about GPU-related research or its application within a project. However, we also encourage anyone to present applications that have compute-related performance issues, which allows the group to give advice on how to improve performance and fix performance issues in the code, possibly with GPUs. Occasionally we invite external speakers, for example academic or industry experts, or masters students who did a related masters projects.

If you would like to present or invite an external speaker, please feel free to subscribe for any of the upcoming sessions in the table below using a pull request.
